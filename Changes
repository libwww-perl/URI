2004-10-05   Gisle Aas <gisle@ActiveState.com>

   Release 1.34

   URI->canonical will now always unescape any escaped unreserved
   chars.  Previously this only happened for the http and https scheme.
   Patch contributed by Eric Promislow <ericp@ActiveState.com>.



2004-09-19   Gisle Aas <gisle@ActiveState.com>

   Release 1.33

   Release 1.32

   Introduce $URI::file::DEFAULT_AUTHORITY which control what
   authority string to use for absolute file URIs.  Its value
   default to "" which produce file URIs that better interoperates
   with other implementations.  The old mapping behaviour can be
   requested by setting this variable to undef.



2004-06-08   Gisle Aas <gisle@ActiveState.com>

   Release 1.31

   Added uri_escape_utf8() function to URI::Escape module.

   Fixed abs/rel behaviour for sip: URIs.  Fixed by
   Ville Skytt채 <ville.skytta@iki.fi>.

   Avoid croaking on code like $u->query_form(a => { foo => 1 }).
   It will still not really do anything useful.



2004-01-14   Gisle Aas <gisle@ActiveState.com>

   Release 1.30

   Documentation fixes by Paul Croome <Paul.Croome@softwareag.com>.



2004-01-02   Gisle Aas <gisle@ActiveState.com>

   Dan Sully <daniel@electricrain.com>.



2003-11-30   Gisle Aas <gisle@ActiveState.com>

   Release 1.28

   The query_param_delete() method was not able to delete
   the last parameter from a form.  Similar problem existing
   when deleting via query_param().  Patch by <awk@awks.org>.

   The query_form() method now allow an array or hash
   reference to be passed to set the value.  This makes it
   possible to set the value to an empty form, something that
   the old API did not allow.

   The query_keywords() method now allow an array reference
   to be passed to set the value.



2003-10-06   Gisle Aas <gisle@ActiveState.com>

   Release 1.27

   The URI module is now less strict about the values accepted
   for gopher_type attribute of gopher:-URLs.  Patch suggested
   by the Net::Gopher author; William G. Davis.



2003-10-03   Gisle Aas <gisle@ActiveState.com>

   Release 1.26

   Help Storable deal with URI objects.  Patch contributed

   Fix failure under OS/2.  Patch contributed by Ilya Zakharevich.



2003-08-18   Gisle Aas <gisle@ActiveState.com>

   Release 1.25

   Allow literal '@' in userinfo.  If there are multiple '@' chars
   in the 'authority' component use the last (instead of first) as
   the 'userinfo' delimiter.

   Make URI->query_form escape '[' and ']'.  These chars where added
   to the reserved set in RFC 2732.  This also matches MSIE behaviour.

   Silence warning from 'sip' support class.



2003-07-24   Gisle Aas <gisle@ActiveState.com>

   Release 1.24

   Relative URIs that start with the query string directly (i.e. "?q")
   are now absolutized as specified in rfc2396bis.  See:
   http://www.apache.org/~fielding/uri/rev-2002/issues.html#003-relative-query
   
   Added URI::Split module.  It's a lightweight module that can be
   used to parse and compose URI string to/from its component parts.

   The rel() method will now work from canonical URIs.  That allow it
   to extract a relative URI in more cases.



2003-01-01   Gisle Aas <gisle@ActiveState.com>

   Release 1.23

   Support for tn3270 URIs.

   urn:oid:, rtsp:, and rtspu:.  The rtsp support was
   contributed by Matt Selsky <selsky@columbia.edu>.

   Documentation fix for $URI::ABS_REMOTE_LEADING_DOTS.
   CPAN-RT-Bug #1224.

   The host for URI::file was not unescaped.
   Patch by Ville Skytt채 <ville.skytta@iki.fi>.



2002-05-09   Gisle Aas <gisle@ActiveState.com>

   Release 1.19

   URI::Heuristic will guess better on strings
   like "123.3.3.3:8080/foo".  It used to think that
   the numbers before ":" was a scheme.

   URI::WithBase will not keep the full history of
   any base URI's base URI etc.  This used to make
   these objects grow into to monsters for some
   web spiders.

   URI::URL->new("foo", "bar")->base used to return
   a "URI" object.  Now an URI::URL object is returned
   instead.

   Deal properly with file:///-URIs.



2001-12-30   Gisle Aas <gisle@ActiveState.com>

   Release 1.18

   Added support for ssh: URIs.
   Contributed by Jean-Philippe Bouchard <jeanphil@sitepak.com>

   URI::Escape: Make sure cache is not set when the RE
   wouldn't compile.  Fix suggested by <me-01@ton.iguana.be>.
   Applied patch as suggested by Randal L. Schwartz.

   Don't try to come up with the e-mail address of the user as
   the anonymous password.
   Patch by Eduardo P챕rez <eperez@dei.inf.uc3m.es>.



2001-09-14   Gisle Aas <gisle@ActiveState.com>

   Release 1.17

   Fixed unescape of %30 in $http_uri->canonical.

   Fixed test failure for t/heuristic.t on cygwin.

   Fixed warning noise from t/old-base.t on bleadperl.
   Perl now warns for pack("c*", $i) when $i > 127.



2001-08-27   Gisle Aas <gisle@ActiveState.com>

   Release 1.16

   URI::Escape::uri_escape default has changed.  Reserved
   characters are now escaped when no second argument is
   provided.

   The perl5.004 backwards compatibility patching taking place
   in the Makefile.PL should now work for MacPerl.
   Patch by KIMURA Takeshi <kim@ga2.so-net.ne.jp>.

   URI::WithBase now overrides the can() method and delegate it to
   the URI member.  This also affects the URI::URL behaviour.
   Patch by Sean M. Burke <sburke@cpan.org>.



2001-07-19   Gisle Aas <gisle@ActiveState.com>

   Release 1.15

   [This release was made just to document the changes that went
    into the (unreleased) URI-1.13 but never made it into this
    change-log.  There is no functional difference between the 1.14
    and 1.15 release.]



2001-07-18   Gisle Aas <gisle@ActiveState.com>

   Release 1.14

   The module failed on perl5.004 because \z is not supported
   in regexps.  The Makefile.PL will now try to patch the module
   to be compatible.



2001-05-15   Gisle Aas <gisle@ActiveState.com>

   Release 1.13 (never made it to CPAN)

   URI.pm now conforms to RFC 2732 which specify how literal IPv6
   addresses are to be included in URLs.

   URI/Escape now allows "/" in the $unsafe pattern argument.



2001-04-23   Gisle Aas <gisle@ActiveState.com>

   Release 1.12

   URI->new($u, $scheme) does no longer fail if given a badly
   formatted scheme string.

   URI::WithBase's clone and base method was basically just
   broken.  This also affected the URI::URL subclass.
   The clone() method did not copy the base, and updating
   the base with the base method always set it to "1".



2001-02-27   Gisle Aas <gisle@ActiveState.com>

   Release 1.11

   The t/heuristic.t test relied on the fact that 'www.perl.no'
   was not registered in DNS.  This is no longer true.
   The penguins at Bouvet Island will hopefully be ignorant
   of Perl forever.



2001-01-10   Gisle Aas <gisle@ActiveState.com>

   Release 1.10

   The $u->query_form method will now escape spaces in
   form keys or values as '+' (instead of '%20').  This also
   affect the $mailto_uri->header() method.  This is actually
   the wrong thing to do, but this practise is now even
   documented in official places like
   http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/interact/forms.html#h-17.13.4.1
   so we might as well follow the stream.

   URI::Heuristic did not work for domain-names with dashes '-'
   in them.  Fixed.

   Documented that $uri->xxx($1) might not work.



2000-08-16   Gisle Aas <gisle@ActiveState.com>

   Release 1.09

   uri_unescape() did not work when given multiple strings
   to decode.  Patch by Nicholas Clark <nick@ccl4.org>.



2000-08-02   Gisle Aas <gisle@ActiveState.com>

   Release 1.08

   ldap URIs now support _scope() and _filter() methods that
   don't have default values.  Suggested by Graham Barr.

   Incorporated old rejected MSWin32 patch to t/old-base.t.
   Hope it works.



2000-06-13   Gisle Aas <gisle@ActiveState.com>

   Release 1.07

   URI::WithBase (and URI::URL) now support $u->new_abs
   constructor.

   URI::WithBase->new("foo", "URI::URL") bug fixed.

   Release 1.04

   Avoid testing for defined(@ISA) and defined(%class::).  Patch
   by Nathan Torkington <gnat@frii.com>.

   $uri->abs() did wrong when the fragment contained a "?"
   character.

   Typo in URI::ldap spotted by Graham Barr.



1999-06-24   Gisle Aas <gisle@aas.no>

   Release 1.03

   Escape all reserved query characters in the individual components
   of $uri->query_form and $uri->query_keywords.

   Make compatibility URI::URL->new("mailto:gisle@aas.no")->netloc
   work again.



1999-03-26   Gisle Aas <gisle@aas.no>

   Release 1.02

   Added URI::ldap.  Contributed by Graham Barr <gbarr@pobox.com>.

   Release 1.01

   MacOS patches from Paul J. Schinder <schinder@leprss.gsfc.nasa.gov>

   New README

   Makefile.PL list MIME::Base64 as PREREQ_PM

   Original $scheme argument not passed to _init() method.

   Automatically add scheme to empty URIs where the scheme
   is required:  URI->new("", "data")

   Documentation update.

   New URI::URL::strict implementation.



1998-09-22   Gisle Aas <aas@sn.no>

   Release 0.09_02

   New internal URI::file::* interface.  Implemented 8.3 mapping
   for "dos".

   More documentation.



1998-09-13   Gisle Aas <aas@sn.no>

   Release 0.09_01

   Use version number with underscore to avoid that the CPAN
   indexer hides the URI::URL from libwww-perl that contains
   all the documentation.

   Started to document the new modules.

   URI::file->new() escape fix which allow Mac file names like
   ::.. to be treated as they should (I think).



1998-09-12   Gisle Aas <aas@sn.no>

   Release 0.09

   Included URI::Escape and URI::Heuristic from LWP.  URI::Escape
   updated with new default set of characters to escape (according
   to RFC 2396) and a faster uri_unescape() function.  URI::Heuristic
   updated with a new function that returns an URI object.

   First argument to URI->new is always treated as a string now.

   URI->new("", URI::WithBase("foo:")) now works.  It returns an
   URI::WithBase object.

   Included Roy T. Fielding's URI parsing/abs tests from

   which overloads the stringify operator.
